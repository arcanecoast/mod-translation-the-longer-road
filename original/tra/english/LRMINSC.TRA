@0    = ~Feel the burning stare of my hamster!~ [MINSC04]
@1    = ~sigh* Ah, yes. I wondered when it will come to this. Somehow I am amazed I am not yet plucking hamster fur out of the collar of my robes every morning.~ [DPJON129]
@2    = ~Eh? No, no throat-grabbing for-goodness. Maybe a little butt-kicking, but great as his furry fury might be, Boo’s feet are but tiny. No, he’s just keeping a watchful eye on you.~
@3    = ~Were your ravings not so meaningless, I might have found them oddly fascinating. But for now...~
@4    = ~While the mage might be a sinister, evil soul-thief, at least he is not a Thayvian. Boo has explained a few things to Minsc.~
@5    = ~I will never forgive myself if I asked what they were!~
@6    = ~Minsc will not say. The wizard has to see for himself. Like Boo always says - life is like a fancy jar of Nuts Assortment. You never know what you’re going to get: a cashew or a peanut.~
