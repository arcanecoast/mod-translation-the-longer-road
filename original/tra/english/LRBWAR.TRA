@0    = ~Godchild, the Blood War is not something you would like to learn about from the inside.~
@1    = ~But... enough of this... I have no desire to brood over the shared memories of the Lower Planes with you.~
@2    = ~Decisions, decisions... Which side should I take, Irenicus?~
@3    = ~Any advice on the choice between the demons and the devils?~
@4    = ~<CHARNAME>, since I find the whole business of the Blood War utterly distasteful I don't particularly care which side you would choose in the conflict between tanar'ri and baatezu.~
@5    = ~This is a conflict that has no limitations. It has boiled on for millennia, and it will continue until the universe comes to its end. Or, rather, the universe will come to its end if the war stops - because it is the only thing that has kept the Abyssal Lords and the Masters of the Nine Hells from going after the business of destroying the Planes altogether.~
@6    = ~Ah, the Blood War - the ultimate destination for the eternally damned, and those mortal mercenaries foolish enough to believe they can profit from that colossal meat grinder. Irenicus, I would not have thought you capable of lasting one day on these fields.~
@7    = ~Do I take it as a slip of a tongue, Sarevok? Yes, you are no stranger to the bloody grounds between the Abyss and Baator.~
