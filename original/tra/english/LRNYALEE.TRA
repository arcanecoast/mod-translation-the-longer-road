@0    = ~You is not the spawn-child, no! Nyalee only speaksies with the spawn-child! Yet... you smell like <PRO_HIMHER>. Have you too stolen someone's heart? Pee hee heee... No... no... It is gone now... You is not tricksing old Nyalee, Broken Scarecrow. Go find a Heart of Straw to fill your empty chest!~
@1    = ~Shut your filthy blabbering mouth, old hag, before I do it for you! <CHARNAME>, I suggest that you pose your question to the witch by yourself.~
@2    = ~Yes, I can sense power in the old woman still. A filthy, un-refined, and un- comprehended parody of it - but power even so. You might want to stay wary of the hag, <CHARNAME>. (chuckles) Or you might simply kill her, as is often your custom, and leave the mystery unsolved.~
@3    = ~Here is a paradox to you in all its splendor: her mortal heart is nothing but a shriveled sack of flesh, yet now that she has it back she weeps at her so-called 'treachery'. I would have laughed at the irony behind this revolting display if I could, godchild. I am glad that I cannot.~
