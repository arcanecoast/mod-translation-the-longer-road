@0    = ~<CHARNAME>, I would not be making 'friends' with a demon if I were you. But it is up to you, of course, to make this choice.~
@1    = ~A cage created by four different elemental mages? Interesting. The creature must have rather unique powers. I wish I had more time to study this intriguing specimen.~
@2    = ~You are too smart for your own good, mortal, and I loathe meddlesome wizards even more than I hate fanatical priests! Yet I want to make a bargain with your leader, not with you.~
@3    = ~His masters were of an old fashioned stock, I see. No self-respecting wizard would keep an imp as an assistant these days.~
@4    = ~And why is it so, oh 'enlightened' one? Please share 'pearls of your wisdom' with the rest of us, chimps. (I hate it when the masked orangutan generalizes like that. And I rather like imps - I think they are stylish!)~
@5    = ~They are too messy. I could never remove the stains properly. Only a maniac would like bits of wings and hoof chips splattered all over the walls of his workshop.~
@6    = ~(sniff) You've hurt my feelings deeply, masked one! I am going to complain to my Masters when they are back.~
