@0    = ~Excellent.  I have access to a Spectral Brand, a Scroll of Wish, and the Jewel of Harmony, all three are rather impressive items.  And there is the gem, as well.  What would you wish to play for?~
@1    = ~I will play for the Jewel of Harmony.~
@2    = ~But I want the Jewel of Harmony as well!~
@3    = ~And so the gem is yours, fair and square.  It means little enough to me. And I feel oddly generous today, so I will add an extra item to cheer you up before the end.~
@4    = ~You desire the Jewel of Harmony, and here it is.  If you wish to play again, I'd appreciate a chance to gain my freedom, friend.~
@5    = ~Why not? I feel rather generous today. Now may I have my prize?~
